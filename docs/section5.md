**Section 5: Automating and orchestrating ML pipelines (~21% of the exam)**

**5.1 Developing end-to-end ML pipelines**

* Data and model validation.
* Ensuring consistent data preprocessing between training and serving.
* Hosting third-party pipelines on Google Cloud (e.g., MLFlow).
* Identifying components, parameters, triggers, and compute needs (e.g., Cloud Build, Cloud Run).
* Orchestration framework (e.g., Kubeflow Pipelines, Vertex AI Pipelines, Cloud Composer).
* Hybrid or multicloud strategies.
* System design with TFX components or Kubeflow DSL (e.g., Dataflow).

**5.2 Automating model retraining**

* Determining an appropriate retraining policy.
* Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) model deployment (e.g., Cloud Build, Jenkins).

**5.3 Tracking and auditing metadata**

* Tracking and comparing model artifacts and versions (e.g., Vertex AI Experiments, Vertex ML Metadata).
* Hooking into model and dataset versioning.
* Model and data lineage.
