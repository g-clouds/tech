**5.1 Developing end-to-end ML pipelines**

* Data and model validation.
* Ensuring consistent data preprocessing between training and serving.
* Hosting third-party pipelines on Google Cloud (e.g., MLFlow).
* Identifying components, parameters, triggers, and compute needs (e.g., Cloud Build, Cloud Run).
* Orchestration framework (e.g., Kubeflow Pipelines, Vertex AI Pipelines, Cloud Composer).
* Hybrid or multicloud strategies.
* System design with TFX components or Kubeflow DSL (e.g., Dataflow).
