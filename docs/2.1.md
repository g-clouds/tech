**2.1 Exploring and preprocessing organization-wide data** (e.g., Cloud Storage, BigQuery, Spanner, Cloud SQL, Apache Spark, Apache Hadoop)

* Organizing different types of data (e.g., tabular, text, speech, images, videos) for efficient training.
* Managing datasets in Vertex AI.
* Data preprocessing (e.g., Dataflow, TensorFlow Extended [TFX], BigQuery).
* Creating and consolidating features in Vertex AI Feature Store.
* Privacy implications of data usage and/or collection (e.g., handling sensitive data such as personally identifiable information [PII] and protected health information [PHI]).
