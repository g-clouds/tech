**Section 1: Architecting low-code ML solutions (~12% of the exam)**

**1.1 Developing ML models using BigQuery ML**

* Building the appropriate BigQuery ML model (e.g., linear and binary classification, regression, time-series, matrix factorization, boosted trees, autoencoders) based on the business problem.
* Feature engineering or selection using BigQuery ML.
* Generating predictions using BigQuery ML.

**1.2 Building AI solutions using ML APIs**

* Building applications using ML APIs (e.g., Cloud Vision API, Natural Language API, Cloud Speech API, Translation).
* Building applications using industry-specific APIs (e.g., Document AI API, Retail API).

**1.3 Training models using AutoML**

* Preparing data for AutoML (e.g., feature selection, data labeling, Tabular Workflows on AutoML).
* Using available data (e.g., tabular, text, speech, images, videos) to train custom models.
* Using AutoML for tabular data.
* Creating forecasting models using AutoML.
* Configuring and debugging trained models.
