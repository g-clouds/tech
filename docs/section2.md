**Section 2: Collaborating within and across teams to manage data and models (~16% of the exam)**

**2.1 Exploring and preprocessing organization-wide data** (e.g., Cloud Storage, BigQuery, Spanner, Cloud SQL, Apache Spark, Apache Hadoop)

* Organizing different types of data (e.g., tabular, text, speech, images, videos) for efficient training.
* Managing datasets in Vertex AI.
* Data preprocessing (e.g., Dataflow, TensorFlow Extended [TFX], BigQuery).
* Creating and consolidating features in Vertex AI Feature Store.
* Privacy implications of data usage and/or collection (e.g., handling sensitive data such as personally identifiable information [PII] and protected health information [PHI]).

**2.2 Model prototyping using Jupyter notebooks**

* Choosing the appropriate Jupyter backend on Google Cloud (e.g., Vertex AI Workbench, notebooks on Dataproc).
* Applying security best practices in Vertex AI Workbench.
* Using Spark kernels.
* Integration with code source repositories.
* Developing models in Vertex AI Workbench using common frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, sklearn, Spark, JAX).

**2.3 Tracking and running ML experiments**

* Choosing the appropriate Google Cloud environment for development and experimentation (e.g., Vertex AI Experiments, Kubeflow Pipelines, Vertex AI TensorBoard with TensorFlow and PyTorch) given the framework.
