**4.2 Scaling online model serving**

* Vertex AI Feature Store.
* Vertex AI public and private endpoints.
* Choosing appropriate hardware (e.g., CPU, GPU, TPU, edge).
* Scaling the serving backend based on the throughput (e.g., Vertex AI Prediction, containerized serving).
* Tuning ML models for training and serving in production (e.g., simplification techniques, optimizing the ML solution for increased performance, latency, memory, throughput).
